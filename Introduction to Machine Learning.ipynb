    "##### ¿Where is machine learning used?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image recognition** for example, Facebook uses machine learning to recognize faces in photos.\n",
    "- **Speech recognition** for example, Siri uses machine learning to recognize your voice and improve its ability to understand you.\n",
    "- **Medical diagnosis** for example, machine learning is used to detect cancer cells in blood samples.\n",
    "- **Statistical arbitrage** for example, machine learning is used to predict the price of stocks.\n",
    "- **Suggestions content** for example, machine learning is used to suggest what you should buy or watch next on Netflix.\n",
    "- **Fraud detection** for example, machine learning is used to detect unusual patterns in credit card transactions.\n",
    "- **Translation** for example, Google uses machine learning to translate text from one language to another.\n",
    "- **Robot locomotion** for example, machine learning is used to teach robots how to walk.\n",
    "- **Self-driving cars** for example, machine learning is used to avoid accidents.\n",
