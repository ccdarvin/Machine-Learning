# Machine Learning

these are my notes machine learning specialization on Coursera, these are just a few notes on what I have believed to be the most important of all specializations

All the code has been written by me and it is different from the one in the course, but it is based on the course.


## Update

In this repository just the first and second courses are available, the third course is not available because this content is as articles or tutorials in [entreda.org](https://entreda.org).
